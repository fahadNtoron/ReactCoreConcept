Here I have practiced some core concept of REACT. Some of them are.

    1. props passing from one component to another
    2. Passing values, function,object etc from one component to another








Some basic knowledge:
    1. react is uniidirectional
    2. passed props can be changed by receiving component
    3.We can write HTML like markup language in REACT componant
